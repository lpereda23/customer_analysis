### Instead of blindly spending money to market a new product to all its' customers, company can analyze which
### customer segment is most likely to buy the new product and only market in said customer segment

### Import part of a customer personality analysis is getting answers such as:
### - What people say about your product: what gives customers' attitude towards the product
### - What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are saying about your product.
